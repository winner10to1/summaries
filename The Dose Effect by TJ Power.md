# The Dose Effect by TJ Power

## Introduction

The Dose Effect by TJ Power is by far one of the best books I've ever read. This action-oriented book gives specific actions that you can try out on a daily basis. It makes a strong case that the modern world has hacked our brains into being less productive, especially for those who have involuntarily become vulnerable to the information that is exposed to them, which demotivates them and makes them unconfident in their daily lives. This includes people who believe that external factors affect their ability to contribute.

The book discusses the four main chemicals in the brain: dopamine, oxytocin, serotonin, and endorphins. It compares how things were 200 years ago to our current situation, then provides guided targeted actions to overcome these modern challenges.

## Summary of the Dopamine Chapter

### Principles of Dopamine

1. **The job of dopamine is to make hard work feel good.**
   It's important to have a goal in mind (something that you desire) for dopamine to be released. When a job is completed, reaffirm that you are getting closer to your goal. An example would be "I have to work hard on this task so that I will get my promotion. And this will definitely make me happy." For dopamine to be released, you have to believe that what you're doing will genuinely help you achieve your ultimate goals.

2. **Controlling the pain-pleasure balance**
   The parts of the brain responsible for pain and pleasure are co-located, which means triggering one manually activates the other to 'balance it out'. Forcefully performing a painful activity, such as pushing yourself in the gym or working hard overtime, will give you a feeling of pleasure afterward (provided you genuinely feel you are getting closer to your goal). Conversely, unconsciously taking part in activities that give too much pleasure without enough work will make your brain trigger pain in response. Your brain will release dynorphin when you do high-dopamine activities, which gives you feelings of low mood, depression, and lack of motivation (like after watching hours of social media).

### Causes of Low Dopamine

The book lists six main causes of low dopamine:
- Sugary foods, alcohol, and drugs
- Pornography
- Social media
- Gambling
- Online shopping

When you work hard and push through feelings of pain, your brain releases dopamine slowly throughout the day, giving you more motivation to work. However, activities that involve little effort but provide large dopamine hits (scrolling social media, watching porn) trigger homeostasis, causing feelings of pain afterward. Your brain knows these unproductive activities won't help you succeed in life.

In the modern world, activities that give rewards without hard work have hacked our brains through dopamine spikes. This progressively narrows the things we like - the definition of addiction. The result is feeling demotivated and depressed, as your brain wants rest from unproductive behaviors. You'll feel distracted due to high dopamine spikes from these distractions (especially affecting those with weak Dopamine Control Circuits - people with ADHD).

The author aims to help readers progressively widen the things they enjoy by eliminating unwanted aspects of modern technology.

### High Dopamine Benefits

A highly dopaminergic person feels energetic, excited, and very productive. They achieve more than normal because they know their activities benefit their life position. The book also mentions willpower and the importance of developing the anterior mid-cingulate cortex (AMCC). With each act of resisting addictive behavior or intentionally performing healthy behaviors, this brain region strengthens. A stronger AMCC leads to more discipline and greater likelihood of success.

## Five Actions to Increase Dopamine

### Action 1: Enter Flow State

This is the mental state achieved when a person doing a task forgets everything around them and focuses completely. In this state, the person observes more information and processes/produces at a faster rate. A stronger AMCC increases capacity to enter flow state.

Examples of flow state activities: reading, playing guitar, working, coding, problem-solving.

Four steps to achieve flow state:

1. **Select the task** - Choose something challenging but achievable within a timeframe. Dopamine is built through effort; harder tasks require more effort and release more dopamine. It's recommended to tackle hard tasks early in the day to increase dopamine release throughout the day.

2. **Tell someone** - Get an accountability partner.

3. **Eliminate distractions** - This could be Teams messages, emails, social media, or any app. Focus only on the selected task.

4. **The stopwatch challenge** - "The start of the task is the hardest." To achieve any task, you must pass 15 minutes of focus. Start a stopwatch and see how long you focus before getting distracted. The goal is to gradually increase from 15 minutes to 30 minutes to 1 hour and beyond.

### Dopamine and ADHD

People with ADHD have low baseline dopamine levels, making them easily carried away by quick dopamine activities that provide greater highs. It's like giving a poor person a day in a luxurious mansion - any cues suggesting another mansion day will distract them from normal work that might actually improve their life.

For those with ADHD symptoms, the author recommends:
1. Having a structured morning routine (with bed making and sun exposure)
2. Exercising as much as possible, especially before hard tasks
3. Reducing quick-dopamine foods, especially in the morning
4. Reducing time spent on video Reels

The author notes that people with ADHD can turn their condition into a benefit by finding something they love. They can excel at things they enjoy more than others because they experience greater dopamine increases (due to their lower baseline).

### Action 2: Discipline

**TLDR:** Clean your bed, house, workspace, and organize them. Make your bed every morning. Never skip doing dishes.

When completing these tasks, if you don't feel accomplished, remind yourself that these actions indirectly help achieve your goals by establishing effective systems.

### Action 3: Phone Fasting

The author warns about excessive phone use and recommends phone fasting to replenish brain dopamine.

**Stage 1: Phone Fasting**
- Designate specific times when your phone is not near you
- During sleep, dopamine regenerates in the brain
- Morning effort increases dopamine levels
- Phone notifications and social media cause dopamine to spike and crash
- Research shows our first dopamine source drives activities throughout the day
- Suggested first activities: reading after making your bed and getting sunlight
- Combine with cold showers, face washing, teeth brushing - anything providing accomplishment
- Follow the rule: "I must see sunlight before I see social media"
- Evening recommendations: exercise, eat, socialize, or watch TV instead of using your phone

**Stage 2: Phone Setup**
- Set up Screen Time as a home screen widget
- Turn off notifications for all but important apps
- Move addictive apps to less accessible screen locations
- For social media use, establish "social media moments" - three specific daily times for guilt-free scrolling
- Rules include: not first thing in morning, not consuming entire lunch break, exercising before scrolling, eating and cleaning up before social media
- Find an accountability partner to increase success with phone fasting

### Action 4: Cold Showers

**TLDR:** Take cold showers in the morning. Gradually increase from 20 seconds to minutes. Cold enough to trigger pain but not necessarily ice cold.

When you trigger pain feelings, your brain responds with pleasure afterward. Research shows cold showers raise baseline dopamine levels 2.5 times normal, matching dopamine levels from cocaine use.

*Note: Avoid cold showers when sick or with flu symptoms. Consult your doctor if you have underlying conditions.*

Cold showers train your brain to do challenging tasks it initially resists. Pro tips:
- Go headfirst into cold water, not body first
- Play energizing music to help you through

### Action 5: Your Pursuit

This section encourages readers to consider what they want in life and what sacrifices they're willing to make. Having desire is essential for dopamine function, as it's designed to keep you alive by encouraging survival activities. Without desire, dopamine drops, potentially leading to depression and demotivation.

Things to pursue:
1. Your career (specific projects to finish)
2. Your health (specific goals; dopamine affects physical health)
3. Your relationships (e.g., "I want to spend 30 mins daily with parents/partner for mutual happiness")
4. Creativity (hobbies without phones!) - the more you use creativity, the better it becomes
5. Your finances
6. Reading the DOSE effect (author's promotion)

## Conclusion

You are in the driver's seat of your life. It's your choice whether to pursue quick dopamine hits that leave you feeling lazy, depressed, and unmotivated, or to prioritize dopamine-building actions that help you achieve more.

The author recommends picking one action and completing the challenges mentioned in the book.
